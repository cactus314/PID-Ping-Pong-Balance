# PID-Ping-Pong-Balance
A PID control demonstration unit, based on a project by Electronoob: http://electronoobs.com/eng_arduino_tut100.php

This project uses an IR sensor to detect the location of a ping-pong ball along a rail and a servo-motor as an actuator to position the angle of the rail to maintain the ball at a given setpoint using hardcoded PID parameters.  The setpoint and P, I, and D gains can also be overridden in "Manual" mode.

A demonstration and explanation of the project is available in the following video:
